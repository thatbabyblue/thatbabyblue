## ⚓️ What I’m About

Who would have thought some dabbling with LLMs, deep learning stuff has become some ongoing interest. I've built and refined **LLM-powered systems**—from training tiny character-level GPTs, wiring up **inference pipelines**, **fine-tuning**, and **tool use/agents** for real apps to creating an AI job search agent. Researching into recent development of LLMs, I also discovered the potential bottleneck of text-based generative models architecture. I found out there's this other architecture, namely world model, has been making some headlines. Google DeepMind recently released [**Genie 3**](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/), which is based on this architecture. I'm exploring more towards that direction.

## 🧠 Deep Learning & LLMs

- **Training/Fine-Tuning**: GPT-style Transformers
- **Inference/Serving**: vLLM, TGI, TensorRT-LLM, quantization (INT8/4), KV-cache tuning
- **Data & Evals**: dataset prep
- **Tooling**: PyTorch

**Recent highlights**
- Built a **MiniGPT** (char-level) from scratch in PyTorch, trained on Shakespeare then fine-tuned on modern English (sampling, top-k/top-p, temperature).
- Implemented a **clean training loop** with gradient clipping, eval cycles, and checkpointing.
- Added **generate.py** with stable inference and safety knobs (temperature/top-k).
